                <span id="uno">" I´ve been interested in coding for a while
                    but never taken the jump, until now.  I
                    couldn´t recommend this course enough.
                    I´m now in the job of my dreams and so 
                    excited about the future. "</span>
                <span id="dos">" If you want to lay the best foundation
                    possible I'd recommend taking this
                    course. The depth the instructors go into
                    is incredible.  I now feel so confident about
                    starting up as a professional developer. "</span>
